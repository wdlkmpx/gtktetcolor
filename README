GtkTetcolor
===========

GtkTetcolor is reimplementation of tetcolor game made for DOS by 
S. Sotnikov on 1991. GtkTetcolor is a game that resembles well-known tetris
and columns. The rules of the game are simple - you can move or rotate
the block which continue to fall. After block landing the sequence of at
least three cells horizontally, vertically or diagonally having matching
colors is removed and the above blocks will collapse. If two or more
sequences will be removed simultaneously the player has got bonus
points. The game will be over when new block cannot be placed on screen. 

Requirements
============

 o GTK+ 2/3


Installation
============

It should be possible to do an installation by doing
    ./configure
    make
    make install
in the top directory.
default /usr/local with --prefix option. For example
    ./configure --prefix=/usr


Sounds
======

Sound files distributed with this version are borrowed from gnome games.
They should be replaced with own wave files. Does anybody help to create them?


Score accounting
================

Since I cannot decrypt formula of DOS tetcolor I use own:

   Score = Bonus + Line,

where Line is points for each deleted line and Bonus is added when
simultaneously more than 1 line disappears.

   Line = 40*(1 + (level - 1)*0.1)*(1 + 0.25*(5 - n)),

where n is number of cells in the line.   

            / (lines - 1)*500,           if 1 < lines <= 11,
	    |
   Bonus = <  5000 + 2500*(lines - 11),  if 11 < lines <= 17,
            |
	    \ 20000 + 5000*(lines - 17), if 17 < lines,

where lines is number of simultaneously destroyed lines.
